REQUIREMENTS
============

* `hddtemp`: (optional)  Show hdd temperature/status.


TEMPERATURE STATUS
==================

As mention above, to show hdd temperature/status, you need to install `hddtemp`
package and run it as a daemon.  `hddtemp` already ships the `rc.d` file, so
all you need to do is:

    sudo pkgman install --deps --group hddtemp
    sudo /etc/rc.d/hddtemp start

Check the status manually:

    sudo hddtemp

The output should look something like:

    /dev/sda: TOSHIBA SERNO: 32°C

Now, you can start `wmhdplop` with `-t` option, like the following:

    wmhdplop -t -d /dev/sda
